# Assignment Introduction to C++
This GitHub is just a mock assignment. It shows how the work will be in this class. It also shows the organization. Each given homework will have its repository when students receive the invitation link and accept the policy. GitHub will create a private repository for each student with the same folder format as this one.

Your homework submission is made through GitHub. You do not need to submit it on Canvas. Work only on the TO-DO files requested down below.

### C++ IDE recommended to use:
    - code::Blocks (Windows, Linux, Mac).
    - CLion c++ IDE by JetBrains (Windows, Linux, Mac). 
    - Visual Studio 2022(Windows only).
    - Visual Studio Code (Windows, Linux, Mac).


## Folders
* cmake-build-debug: \
  This folder is not shown in GitHub, but if you run cmake on your local device. This folder is created when building a CMake file with cmake. To read more about it, check cmake [website](https://cmake.org/overview/)
* src:\
  This folder will contain the .cpp functions or classes we will use in our homework. Also, it will have comments related to the assignment part.
* .gitignore: \
  This GitHub file is used to let git knows which files to ignore and not push. These are usually autogenerated files or systems files that you don't use. If you are using a different C++ IDE, please check the GitHub website for .gitignore content you don't need to push to your repo. [github for .gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
* CMakeLists.txt:\
  It is part of cmake building management and tells how each folder is built and the links between each folder.
* README.md:\
  They are used in GitHub to show the introduction page in GitHub. It uses markdown language to format the documentation. Some useful information about [markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
* main.cpp:\
  This is the main C++ code file. We use the compiler to build it. you may also see .cc or .cxx .C .c++. It is all meant for the same purpose as a suffix for a c++ file.

# Problem/Question:
Here will be the main question or concept we will work on in the course.
## TO-DO: (this is just an example to familiarize yourself)
- Edit your name on top of the README.md file. And save changes to show your name.
- Edit files in the src folder only:
    - fullname.cpp --> change default name = "X" to "None"
- Run main.cpp to see if the code works well.

## Setup your C++ environment, you will need:
- text Editor or IDE.
- C++ compiler:
    - g++ for UNIX/Linux.
    - Xcode/clang Mac OS.
    - you need minGW and then GCC for windows.
- cmake

## Open your PC terminal/PowerShell and check if you have g++, or gcc, or clang compiler (one of them) and CMake :
-  g++ -v or g++ --version
- gcc -v or gcc --version
- clang -v or clang --version
- cmake --version

If your terminal doesn't find the version, you need to install one of the compilers for your operating system.
